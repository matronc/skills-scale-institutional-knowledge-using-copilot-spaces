# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Quick Reference
- [Role-Responsibility Matrix](role-responsibility-matrix.md) — Use to clarify ownership and decision-making for key activities

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Assign roles and responsibilities using the [Role-Responsibility Matrix](role-responsibility-matrix.md)

## Team Structure & Roles
When creating the Project One-pager, include a "Proposed team / roles" section that identifies:
- Core roles (Product Manager, Project Manager, Developers, QA Lead)
- Additional personas as needed (UX Designer, DevOps Engineer, Scrum Master, Business Analyst, Security Liaison, etc.)
- Refer to [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for descriptions and responsibilities
- Use the [Role-Responsibility Matrix](role-responsibility-matrix.md) to clarify RACI for key activities

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
